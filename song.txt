Come up to meet you, tell ya I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell ya I need you
Tell you I set you apart

Tell me your secrets and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Runnin' in circles, comin' up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start
